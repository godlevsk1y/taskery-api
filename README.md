# Taskery REST API

This is an API for the taskery application – a CLI cloud-based application for making tasks and todo lists.

The plan of development:
1. Create domain logic layer (models, rules, value objects, etc.) following DDD principles as well as possible 
2. Create application layer with services, that would provide the interface to the core application
3. Create layer for data access
4. Design and implement the REST API
